{title: 'Question of the Day!(?)', author: 'McJagger', content: 'Welcome back readers. Today is question of the day comes from New Zealand, reader Michelle asks: \'What is your signature move? Like I mean what do you think everyone you know would be like, \"Oh shiiit thats totally you in an action or phrase or like gersture or something like that\" you get what I mean McJagger?\'. Well Michelle you mispelled what I can only assume means to be *gesTure*. Normally due to this kind of egrigious error I would completely ignore the question, but I think it is a rather interesting question. I say rather because I think I\'m British, I\'m quite condiment about that. but I mayo be incorrect in that. Anyways, I mustard answer this question, recently it would be the food related puns that I throw in my casual conversations that people first assume would be a misspeaking of a word but is more of an insane inside joke.
