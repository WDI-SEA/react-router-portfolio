        <p>Hi! I'm Emily. I'm learning how to code and absolutely LOVING it so far. I hope to someday work in Biotech with these new skills I'm acquiring. I live in Seattle and when I'm not typing away on my computer, I love to rock climb, trail run, get lost in a good book, explore new coffee shops, and bake fun desserts.</p>
