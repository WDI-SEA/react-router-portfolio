                    <h1>As a chef turned software engineer, I have a particular knack for providing     intuitive and low-impact solutions for the end-user. With my background in the  restaurant industry, I prioritize planning and organization that lead to     thoughtful results, while still being able to think on my feet when necessary. My   goal is to create software that doesnâ€™t burden the user, it allows them to be     their best creative self. </h1>
