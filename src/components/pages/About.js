                <p>I am what my mom calls a 'street gurl', but I love identifying as a labradoodle. I am 5 years old, turning 6 soon. Me and my mom met my dad 3 and a half years ago. My little sister Luna was born last year and has been annoying me ever since. My mom and dad say a new brother or sister is on the way but this time it's not a furry kind, whatever that means. </p>
