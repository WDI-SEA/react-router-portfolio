      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I went to Mizzou. Got a BS in Mechanical Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science. After that I worked for 3 years as a software developer writing object oriented PLC code for industrial machinery. While working, I studied at night and passed the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam for Electrical and Computer Engineering. After that I worked as an engineer/electrician installing control panels to automate lighting and refrigeration for power savings. I missed coding so much that I ended up leaving that job in order to study and eventually become a full fledged web developer. After a long 8 months of studying and job hunting with little success, I enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive 13 week coding bootcamp. With a slate of cool personal projects and professional instruction under my belt, I am back to applying. Just looking for someone to let me show what I can do.</p>
