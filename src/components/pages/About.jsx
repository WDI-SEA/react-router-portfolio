            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently a software engineering fellow at General assembly and for the past 8 weeks I have been learning full-stack development fundamentals and immersing myself in the tech field. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Before committing to learning software engineering, I was a recent graduate from the University of Washington where I received a B.S. in Physiology. Out of college I was pursuing a career in dentistry while also working in online retail as well as an after-school activity coordinator in a Middle School.

                <br/>
                I ultimately had a difficult realization that my passion for the field of dentistry didn’t quantify the time and financial investment it took to continue on. My focus shifted to software engineering which is a field I was always interested in but was too tunnel visioned on pursuing a career in dentistry to give it a good shot.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Now that I am more than two-thirds of the way through my bootcamp, I’m beginning to realize that I find this experience really fun. I’m learning a lot about myself and how much I enjoy problem solving and finding efficient solutions, as well as collaborating with others to reach deadlines/requirements.
