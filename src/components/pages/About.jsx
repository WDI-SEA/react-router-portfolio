                    Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Garrett Heiner and I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer based in Phoenix, AZ. With a passion for programming, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a driven and determined professional, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and achieving ambitious goals. I possess a results-oriented mindset and a natural ability to lead and inspire others, whether working independently or as part of a team. Quality work and creativity are at the forefront of my approach to software development, as I always strive to make projects stand out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My skills include JavaScript (express, node.js, react), SQL (PostgresSQL), Heroku, HTML, HTML5, CSS, and Ruby. I have worked on a range of projects, including Everyone's A Critic, a movie-themed social media platform, where I implemented a database with tables for users, movies, and comments. I also created a browser-based game called The Brdige Troll's Toll, where I utilized HTML5, CSS, & JavaScript DOM manipulation to render the gameplay, and ran audio clips during gameplay.

                </p>

                <p>
                    My professional experience includes working as a Loan Officer at American Pacific Mortgage where I developed strong analytical, problem-solving, communication, negotiation, and organizational skills. My aptitude for learning and adapting to new technologies was demonstrated through my use of various technology platforms and digital tools to effectively market properties, analyze trends, and manage transactions.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently enrolled in an immersive software development course at General Assembly, with a focus on full-stack web development. I am excited to continue to grow my skills and contribute to the software engineering community.
